# Lab Overview

Scenario: A former employee conducted a brute-force attack on the admin panel of yummyrecipesforme.com, injected malicious JavaScript to prompt downloads of a malware executable, and redirected users to a fake site.

Objectives:

Capture and analyze network traffic (tcpdump) to identify DNS, TCP, and HTTP protocols in use.

Observe the malware download and redirection behavior in a sandbox environment.

Inspect the compromised source code to locate the injected payload.

Document the incident in a formal security incident report.

Recommend a remediation to prevent future brute-force attacks.
