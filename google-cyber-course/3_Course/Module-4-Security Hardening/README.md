# Lab Overview
- **Scenario:** A former employee conducted a brute-force attack on the admin panel of yummyrecipesforme.com, injected malicious JavaScript to prompt downloads of a malware executable, and redirected users to a fake site.
    
- **Objectives:**
    
    1. Capture and analyze network traffic (`tcpdump`) to identify DNS, TCP, and HTTP protocols in use.
        
    2. Observe the malware download and redirection behavior in a sandbox environment.
        
    3. Inspect the compromised source code to locate the injected payload.
        
    4. Document the incident in a formal security incident report.
        
    5. Recommend a remediation to prevent future brute-force attacks.
